# Assembly Instructions

## Preparing the Osmotic Pumps

**Pre-prep:**

- **Prepare the cannula:** Shave down two opposing halves of a cannula and use epoxy to combine them, such that the catheter tubing is approximatly 1mm apart.
- **Prepare catheter tubing:** Cut tubing to approx 1.5in
- **Prepare the filling syringe:** Using an angled blunt syringe, attach catheter tubing to the syringe, then the stainless steel tube to the end of the catheter tubing

**Pump Prep:**

1. Remove flow moderators from stainless steel tubes
2. Heat 0.9% saline to 37°C
3. Remove the cannula from the tubing
4. Attach the stainless steel tube to the catheter tubing below the cap, where the catheter tubing covers 3mm of the stainless steel tube
5. Prepare ACSF
6. One catheter tube at a time, insert the stainless steel tube of the filling syringe into the distal end of the catheter
7. Fill the catheter and the stainless steel tube using the filling syringe
8. Leaving the filling syring attached, fill the pump with ACSF using the sterile filling needle:
- Weigh the empty pump (0.35g)
- Fill the pump with 27 guage filling syringe until liquid comes out the top
- Weigh the filled pump (0.45g)
9. With the filling syring still attached, insert the flow moderator into the pump, ensuring there are no bubbles
10. Remove the filling syringe and reattach the cannula
11. Repeat the same for the othe side
  12. Incubate the pumps (no the caps - keep them dry) in 37°C 0.9% saline
